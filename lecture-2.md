### What is an abstraction?

#### :TODO:
---
Task 1: For every number in a list increase it by its own value
```javascript
const list1 = [56, -122, 12, -5, 212, 34, -25]

let list2 = []
for (let i in list1) {
	list2[i] = list1[i] + list[i]
}
console.log(list2) // [ 112, -244, 24, -10, 424, 68, -50 ]
```
___
Task 2: Turn every negative number to its positive counter part

```javascript
let list3 = []
for (let i in list2) {
	if (list2[i] < 0) {
		list3[i] = list2[i] * -1
	} else {
		list3[i] = list2[i]
	}
}
console.log(list3) // [ 112, 244, 24, 10, 424, 68, 50 ]
```

Generalization: find similarities and hide them behind the abstraction

```javascript
const iterateOverList = (lst) => {
	result = []
	for (let i in lst) {
		result[i] = fn(lst[i])
	}
	return result
}
```
___
Specialize: using abstraction provide only what is neccessary for an use-case

```javascript
const increastByItself = x => x + x
const makePositive = x => x < 0 ? x * -1 : x

list2 = iterateOverList(list1, increastByItself)
list3 = iterateOverList(list2, makePositive)
```
---
We can do better by using already existing abstraction.

```javascript
const map => (list, fn) => list.map(fn)
const double => (x) => x * 2
const abs = x = x < 0 ? x * -1 : x

```
This helps to generalize code even more so making more useful in other scenarios.

Functional programming is all about composing small functions into bigger ones.

### Why?
* Helps to re-use code
* Abstracts 

---

Having two functions
`f: A --> B`
`g: B --> C`

Then there must exist function `h: A --> C`

This function can be defined as composition of `f` and `g`:
`f . g = x => f(g(x)``

---
In JS world:

```javascript
const compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x))
```
