### What is an abstraction?

Task: Find largest number in a list
```javascript
const list1 = [56, 12, 212, 25]
```
---
```javascript
const list1 = [56, 12, 212, 25]

const findMax = (arr) => (

```

Functional programming is all about composing small functions into bigger ones.

### Why?
* Helps to re-use code
* Abstracts 

---

Having two functions
`f: A --> B`
`g: B --> C`

Then there must exist function `h: A --> C`

This function can be defined as composition of `f` and `g`:
`f . g = x => f(g(x)``

---
In JS world:

```javascript
const compose = (f, g) => x => f(g(x))
```
